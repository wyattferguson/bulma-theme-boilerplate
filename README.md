# Sierra SCSS Framework Theme Boilerplate

A completely bare bones basic theme template with [Sierra SCSS Library](https://sierra-library.github.io/) and parcel to make development and deployment super simple.

## :wrench: Setup

1. Install npm if you havent already. They have a nice [simple tutorial](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) if you need. npm will let everything come together super easy.

2. Install all the theme dependecies with
   `npm install`

## :microscope: Local Development

For local development run:
`npm run dev`

this spins up a small local server for you at
`http://localhost:1234`

Its just that simple!

## :rocket: Deployment

When your ready to launch your masterpiece just run:
`npm run build`

this will compile all your files and content and ouput everything into the `/dist` folder. Upload those files to your webhost of choice and baby you got yourself a website!
